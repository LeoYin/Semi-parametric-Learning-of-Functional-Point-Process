Research Project;

Project Status: working;

Introduction to the project "Semi-parametric Learning of Functional Point Process",

key words: Functional PCA; multi-level analysis; stock transactions;
 
 ## Brief Introduction to the Project
 ### Project Aims
 To propose a model to describe human activity patterns;
 
 To develope a method to efficiently fit the proposed model;
 
 To apply the model to investigate the transaction activities of stock investors;
 
 ### Data Description
The team has access to detailed transaction records (i.e., time stamps of buying/selling stocks at the second level) of 1.2 million stock trading accounts from a national leading brokerage house in China from January 4th, 2007 to September 30th, 2009.
 
 Figure below shows the time stamps for three stock investors in a window of 30 consecutive days; The black points indicate the buying activities on the timeline and the red points indicate the selling activities on the timeline;

 ### Methodology
 Multi-level functional Poisson process model;
 
 Semi-parametric functional PCA;
 
 
 ### Results
 The Figure below shows the estimations of intensity functions of stock buying and selling activities;
